- throw out word markers
- remove gate
- remove global 
- refer baseline Kim et al (tf version github)
- character clusters

- fix output part so that new morphemes are predicted
- predict character clusters and combine them to get words 

take dev set, isolate OoV words, look at how many words are fully correctly predicted by LMMRL

some morphological variant of those OoV is predicted

prediction probs 

"tackle morphological variants of OoV"
"select student partner"
