TODO
- choose cue words and find closest words according to both char and word level embeddings
- split sentences across batches and reset state after each sentence
- debug each module separately

IDEAS
- orthogonality constraint on char and word level embeddings
    - issue: different sized embeddings
- attention layer for generating word vector of next word
    - use sliding window of fixed length for context
- char + ngrams instead of convolutional layer
