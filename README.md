# Exploring Hybrid Models for Morphologically Rich Languages
This repository contains the code for my seminar (CS 396) under the guidance of Prof. Preethi Jyothi at IIT Bombay during July 2018 - present. This research is inspired by these papers:
* **Language Modeling for Morphologically Rich Languages: Character-Aware Modeling for Word-Level Prediction**, *Gerz et al* [TACL 2018] \[[pdf](http://people.ds.cam.ac.uk/dsg40/paper/lmmrl/LMMRL.pdf)\]
* **Compositional Morphology for Word Representations and Language Modelling**, *Botha et al* [ICML 2014] \[[pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1405.4273.pdf)\]
